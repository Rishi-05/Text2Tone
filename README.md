# Text2Tone

Convert text (including PDFs) into speech using a simple Flask web app.

##  Overview

Text2Tone is a lightweight and user-friendly Flask application that transforms written text into spoken audio. Using `pdfplumber` for PDF text extraction and `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) for speech synthesis, it allows users to upload or input text and immediately hear it spoken backâ€”and download it if needed.

##  Features

- Extracts text from PDF files using `pdfplumber`
- Converts text into speech using offline TTS (via `pyttsx`)
- Built with Flask for web accessibility
- Supports both text input and PDF uploads
- Ideal for creating audio versions of documents
